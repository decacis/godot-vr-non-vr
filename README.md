# Godot VR and Non-VR Example

Basic example of a game that supports VR and non-VR mode.

Press **ENTER** to switch to VR mode. The game will close and the next time it starts, it will start in VR. In a release build the game will restart automatically, but you have to run the project again in debug mode (in the editor).
